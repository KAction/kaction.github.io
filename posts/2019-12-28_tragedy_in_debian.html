<h1 id="tragedy-in-debian-my-tragedy">Tragedy in Debian, my tragedy</h1>
<p>The latest General Resolution in Debian is over. Systemd is officially the only supported init system, everything else is “exploring alternatives”. I already wrote<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a>, why in fact it means lack of any (sane) alternative.</p>
<p>Debian betrayed its own heritage, betrayed Unix spirit, and gave in to siren song of oblivious nemesis – Red Hat company. Debian decided to welcome clueless and banish hackerdom.</p>
<p>I should have seen it coming. It started five years ago, when systemd became default init system, but resolution of techinical comitete gave hope. And I gladly swallowed it, since it was the only hope.</p>
<p>Debian has favored GitLab because of its clicky-clicky interface, because it is so nice to those who did not bothered to learn git. Nobody cares that it is inconvenient for those who did, right<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2" role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a>?</p>
<p>Debian adopted “code of conduct” and created “community team”. Not that they are harmful by themself, but they are bad signs.</p>
<p>I should have seen it coming, but year ago I sat behind my computer, days and night, triaging bugs in src:sysvinit. I thought that if I resolve them all… Lesson learned: techincal merits and software design means nothing compared to marketing, even if decision makers are developers. Debian Developers.</p>
<p>Maybe it is yet another mistake, but I today I choose not to learn who exactly did that. I am afraid of learning that all those nice folks, with whom I worked and who supported me during my hard times AFK, are those who did hold the hammer devastated Debian. I am not ready for this knowledge.</p>
<p>For long time Debian was my home and my identification, but no longer. I quit. Who am I now? I am yet to discover.</p>
<p>I thank Init Diversity Team, and specially Lorenzo Puliti. Live long and prosper.</p>
