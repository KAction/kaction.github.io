<p>[ warn: this email is sent to both private and public list. ]</p>
<p>Hello.</p>
<p>Year ago I escaped my country due legal threats<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a>, left my established life-flow behind and fled to the USA. For whole year I had no legal right to have a (paid) job, so I had two major occupations – legal paperwork and volunteering in Free Software, Debian in particular.</p>
<p>Several days ago I received legal work authorization. So, it is time to get $dayjob, pay bills and debts, and set up new life in new unfamiliar environment. I expect it to be the most complicated transition I ever had and to consume most of 168 hours a week. Hope I will have resources to fix RC bugs. I have no idea for how long.</p>
<p>I am looking for a job. If you want to hire me, or know somebody who may want to hire me – please let me know.</p>
<p>So many things left undone, so many projects left unfinished. <a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2" role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a> The biggest of my concerns is sysvinit. Init-diversity team did good job on bringing package into good shape lately, but somebody personally have to assume the lead – take control of git and patch-flow, lead discussions to resolution and taking heat for that resolution. For some time, it was me. Thorsten Glaser, maybe it will be you who will catch the flag?</p>
