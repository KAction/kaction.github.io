I have recently set up a new, hardware-based, OpenPGP key, and will be
transitioning away from my old key.

The old key will continue to be valid for some time, but I prefer all
future correspondence to come to the new one. I would also like this
new key to be re-integrated into the web of trust.  This message is
signed by both keys to certify the transition.

The old key was:

/home/kaction/.gnupg/pubring.kbx
- --------------------------------
sec#  rsa4096 2017-11-03 [CA] [expires: 2020-03-03]
      7214B3C8D5FF8F26E12593D52E20FEEE71FC7D81
uid           [ultimate] Dmitry Bogatov <kaction@disroot.org>
uid           [ultimate] Dmitry Bogatov <KAction@debian.org>
uid           [ultimate] Dmitry Bogatov <KAction@gnu.org>
ssb   rsa4096 2017-11-03 [S] [expires: 2020-03-03]
ssb   rsa4096 2017-11-03 [A] [expires: 2020-03-03]
ssb   rsa4096 2017-11-03 [E] [expires: 2020-03-03]

And the new key is:

/home/kaction/upload/gnupghome/pubring.kbx
- ------------------------------------------
sec   ed25519 2020-01-12 [SC]
      3F870A7CA7B437312F136083749FD4DFA2E94236
uid           [ultimate] Dmitry Bogatov <KAction@disroot.org>
ssb   cv25519 2020-01-12 [E]

To fetch the full key from a public key server, you can simply do:

  gpg --keyserver keys.riseup.net --recv-key 3F870A7CA7B437312F136083749FD4DFA2E94236

If you already know my old key, you can now verify that the new key is
signed by the old one:

  gpg --check-sigs 3F870A7CA7B437312F136083749FD4DFA2E94236

If you don't already know my old key, or you just want to be double
extra paranoid, you can check the fingerprint against the one above:

  gpg --fingerprint 3F870A7CA7B437312F136083749FD4DFA2E94236

If you are satisfied that you've got the right key, and the UIDs match
what you expect, I'd appreciate it if you would sign my key. You can
do that by issuing the following command:

**
NOTE: if you have previously signed my key but did a local-only
signature (lsign), you will not want to issue the following, instead
you will want to use --lsign-key, and not send the signatures to the
keyserver
**

  gpg --sign-key 3F870A7CA7B437312F136083749FD4DFA2E94236

I'd like to receive your signatures on my key. You can either send me
an e-mail with the new signatures (if you have a functional MTA on
your system):

  gpg --export 3F870A7CA7B437312F136083749FD4DFA2E94236 | gpg --encrypt -r 3F870A7CA7B437312F136083749FD4DFA2E94236 --armor | mail -s 'OpenPGP Signatures' kaction@disroot.org

Please let me know if you have any questions, or problems, and sorry
for the inconvenience.
